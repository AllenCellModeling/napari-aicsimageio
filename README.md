_While upstream `aicsimageio` is released under BSD-3 license, this plugin is released under GPLv3 license because it installs all format reader dependencies._

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install napari-aicsimageio`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio.git`

### Plugin Variants

![screenshot of plugin sorter showing that napari-aicsimageio-in-memory should be placed above napari-aicsimageio-out-of-memory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/plugin-sorter.png)

There are two variants of this plugin that are added during installation:

-   `aicsimageio-in-memory`, which reads an image fully into memory
-   `aicsimageio-out-of-memory`, which delays reading ZYX chunks until required.
    This allows for incredibly large files to be read and displayed.

## Examples of Features

#### General Image Reading

All image file formats supported by
[aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio) will be read and all
raw data will be available in the napari viewer.

In addition, when reading an OME-TIFF, you can view all OME metadata directly in the
napari viewer thanks to `ome-types`.

#### Multi-Scene Selection

When reading a multi-scene file, a widget will be added to the napari viewer to manage
scene selection (clearing the viewer each time you change scene or adding the
scene content to the viewer) and a list of all scenes in the file.

#### Access to the AICSImage Object and Metadata

![napari viewer with console open showing `viewer.layers[0].metadata`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/console-access.png)

You can access the `AICSImage` object used to load the image pixel data and
image metadata using the built-in napari console:

```python
img = viewer.layers[0].metadata["aicsimage"]
img.dims.order  # TCZYX
img.channel_names  # ["Bright", "Struct", "Nuc", "Memb"]
img.get_image_dask_data("ZYX")  # dask.array.Array
```

The napari layer metadata dictionary also stores a shorthand
for the raw image metadata:

```python
viewer.layers[0].metadata["raw_image_metadata"]
```

The metadata is returned in whichever format is used by the underlying
file format reader, i.e. for CZI the raw metadata is returned as
an `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`, for OME-TIFF the raw metadata is returned
as an `OME` object from `ome-types`.

Lastly, if the underlying file format reader has an OME metadata conversion function,
you may additionally see a key in the napari layer metadata dictionary
called `"ome_types"`. For example, because the AICSImageIO
`CZIReader` and `BioformatsReader` both support converting raw image metadata
to OME metadata, you will see an `"ome_types"` key that stores the metadata transformed
into the OME metadata model.

```python
viewer.layers[0].metadata["ome_types"]  # OME object from ome-types
```

#### Mosaic Reading

When reading CZI or LIF images, if the image is a mosaic tiled image, `napari-aicsimageio`
will return the reconstructed image:

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information related to developing the code.

For additional file format support, contributed directly to
[AICSImageIO](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio).
New file format support will become directly available in this
plugin on new `aicsimageio` releases.
