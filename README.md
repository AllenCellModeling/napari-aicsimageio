AICSImageIO bindings for napari

---

## Features
* Supports reading metadata and imaging data for:
    * `CZI`
    * `OME-TIFF`
    * `TIFF`
    * Any formats supported by [aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio)
    * Any additional format supported by [imageio](https://github.com/imageio/imageio)

## Installation
**Stable Release:** `pip install napari-aicsimageio`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio.git`

### Plugin Variants

![screenshot of plugin sorter showing that napari-aicsimageio-in-memory should be placed above napari-aicsimageio-out-of-memory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/plugin-sorter.png)

There are two variants of this plugin that are added during installation:
* `aicsimageio-in-memory`, which reads an image fully into memory
* `aicsimageio-out-of-memory`, which delays reading ZYX chunks until required.
This allows for incredible large files to be read and displayed.

## Examples of Features

#### General Image Reading

All image file formats supported by
[aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio) will be read and all
raw data will be available in the napari viewer.

In addition, when reading an OME-TIFF, you can view all OME metadata directly in the
napari viewer thanks to `ome-types`.

#### Mosaic CZI Reading

When reading CZI images, if the image is a mosaic tiled image, `napari-aicsimageio`
will return the reconstructed image:

#### Mosaic LIF Reading

When reading LIF images, if the image is a mosaic tiled image, `napari-aicsimageio`
will return the reconstructed image:

## Development
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information related to developing the code.

For additional file format support, contributed directly to
[AICSImageIO](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio).
New file format support will become directly available in this
plugin on new `aicsimageio` releases.
